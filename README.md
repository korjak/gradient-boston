## Kaggle InClass competition - predicting housing prices

This is the code I have written to make a submission to the Kaggle competition for students from scientific circle Gradient (Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology). 

final.py     - creates a submission </br>
tester.py    - used to find the best lambda value (which eventually turned out to be 0)

Because of creating this in rush, I was using intuition rather than data based approach. I measured significance of particular features using correlation coefficients - that part is not included.
